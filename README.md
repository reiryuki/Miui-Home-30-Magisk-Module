- Install this module https://www.pling.com/p/1680776/ via Magisk app or KernelSU app or Recovery if Magisk installed
- If you want App Vault to be working, install Miui App Vault Magisk Module: https://github.com/reiryuki/Miui-App-Vault-Magisk-Module & Miui Security Magisk Module: https://github.com/reiryuki/Miui-Security-Center-Magisk-Module except in global mode
- If you are using KernelSU, you need to disable Unmount Modules by Default in KernelSU app settings
- Reboot
- If you are using KernelSU, you need to allow superuser list manually all package name listed in package.txt (enable show system apps) and reboot afterwards
- Change your default launcher to this Miui Home System Launcher via Settings app (or you can copy the content of default.sh and paste it to Termux app. Type su and grant root first!)
- If you change from hardware navbar to software navbar or vice-versa, you need to force stop this launcher to fix display bug.

## Known Issues
- Some widgets doesn't work
- Uninstall app requires 2 confirmations
- Minimize button in Freeform window doesn't work because I'm using "setTaskAlwaysOnTop" method so it can be showed on top of current task
